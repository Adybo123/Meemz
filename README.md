# Meemz
### A quick, simple meme viewer.

### How to use?
Simply download a build for your OS, or if I haven't been bothered to build for your OS yet, download the source and build it yourself with the Electron Packager scripts.
Click anywhere on the application to advance to the next image, or right click on the image or username to copy it.

### How does it work?
Meemz scrapes Reddit using the api to view the best images on /r/memes by upvotes. Additionally, it saves a JSON file containing the Reddit ID of every image you've seen, and skips them, so you never see the same meme twice, even between application restarts.

### Why?
I am very bored, I like Node & Electron, and I have a lot of free time. Also, clicking on Reddit links all day and seeing the same things twice sucks.
